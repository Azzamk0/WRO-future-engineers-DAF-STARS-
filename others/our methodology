Our Methodology
====

Hardware Setup:
Connect Ultrasonic Sensors:

Attach the 2 front ultrasonic sensors and 2 ultrasonic sensors on both sides to the appropriate ports on the Spike Prime hub.
Connect Motors:

Connect the motor for steering and the motor for movement to their respective ports on the Spike Prime hub.
Software Configuration:
Install Spike Prime App:

Download and install the Spike Prime app on your device (smartphone, tablet, etc.) to program and control the Spike Prime hub.
Create a New Project:

Open the Spike Prime app and create a new project for your competition vehicle.
Add and Configure Ultrasonic Sensors:

Drag and drop ultrasonic sensor blocks into the programming workspace for the front and side sensors.
Configure the blocks to read sensor data and use it for obstacle detection and navigation.
Add and Configure Motor Blocks:

Drag and drop motor blocks into the programming workspace to control steering and movement based on sensor input.
Configure the blocks to control the motors for smooth steering and movement.
Program Logic:

Write the necessary code to implement the behavior and functionality required for the competition. This may include obstacle avoidance, navigation, and any other specific tasks.
Test the Program:

Test the program on your Spike Prime hub to ensure the sensors and motors are functioning correctly and the vehicle is behaving as expected.
Uploading Files and Datasets (if required):
Connecting to an SBC/SBM:

If using a Single Board Computer (SBC) or Single Board Microcontroller (SBM), connect it to the Spike Prime hub following the manufacturer's instructions.
Uploading Files and Datasets:

Transfer any required files, datasets, or additional resources to the SBC/SBM to enhance the functionality or performance of your competition vehicle.
Communication Protocol (if required):
Define Communication Protocol:

If needed, define a communication protocol between the Spike Prime hub and the SBC/SBM for data exchange and coordination.
Implement Communication Logic:

Write the necessary code on both the Spike Prime hub and the SBC/SBM to facilitate communication according to the defined protocol.
Ensure thorough testing and debugging of the vehicle's performance and functionality to ensure it meets the competition requirements.
